    "You are tasked with solving the Map Coloring Problem for the regions of Australia using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach. Your goal is to assign one of three colors (Red, Green, or Blue) to each region such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.\n",

    "Regions of Australia:\n",
    "The regions to be colored are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. WA: Western Australia\n",
    "2. NT: Northern Territory\n",

    "4. NSW: New South Wales\n",
    "5. V: Victoria\n",
    "6. SA: South Australia\n",
    "7. T: Tasmania\n",

    "\n",
    "Adjacency Constraints:\n",
    "Some regions are adjacent to one another, meaning they cannot be assigned the same color. The following regions are adjacent:\n",

    "1. WA is adjacent to NT and SA.\n",
    "2. NT is adjacent to WA, SA, and Q.\n",
    "3. Q is adjacent to NT, SA, and NSW.\n",
    "4. NSW is adjacent to Q, SA, and V.\n",
    "5. V is adjacent to NSW and SA.\n",
    "6. SA is adjacent to WA, NT, Q, NSW, and V.\n",
    "7. T (Tasmania) is an island and has no neighboring regions, so it can be any color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "Implement a backtracking search algorithm that assigns one of three colors (Red, Green, Blue) to each region such that adjacent regions have different colors.\n",
    "Solve the problem and print the color assigned to each region."
